# Requirements

## CakePHP 5.x

SvgIcons is a cakePHP helper so it requires cakePHP.  
We are planning to make a version for cakePHP 4.x and maybe for 3.x

## A package manager

Most providers have packages for javascript like [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

Some providers make versions for [composer](https://getcomposer.org).  
If it’s supported it would be nice only to have to upgrade one package manager for upgrades :)
